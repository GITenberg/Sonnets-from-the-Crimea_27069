<h3>A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH</h3>

<h2><a name="ADAM_MICKIEWICZ" id="ADAM_MICKIEWICZ"></a>ADAM MICKIEWICZ</h2>

<h3>(1798-1855)</h3>

<p>The last of the eighteenth century was an important
period for Russia and Poland, not only politically,
but in letters and art. It marked the birth of statesmen,
patriots, poets and writers. It was into a Poland of great
names and greater activities that Adam Mickiewicz was
born in 1798, as son of an impoverished family of the old
nobility. Three years before, the third and last partition of
his native land had taken place, and the signed documents
had been hastened to Petersburg to make more triumphant
the birthday of the Great Catherine.</p>

<p>Just a few years before this (1792), Kosciusko had courageously
led his forty-five thousand valiant Poles in their
brave defiance of an overwhelming number of Cossacks
and Russians. History had recorded the bloody Turkish
wars, the Pugatshev rebellion, the uprising of the Zaporogian
Cossacks and the Polish confederations. And with the
nineteenth century came the Napoleonic wars with the
dramatic entry of Napoleon into Russia, and a new and
different mental life began to dawn over Europe.</p>

<p>Mickiewicz was born in Novogrodek in Lithuania. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VIII" id="Page_VIII">[VIII]</a></span>
was the birthplace of Count Henry Rzewuski, who wrote
the delightful memories of the Polish eighteenth century,
under the title of "The Memories of Pan Severin Soplica,"<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[*]</a>
and who declared he considered it an honor to be born a
"schlazig" (noble) of Lithuania, and of Novogrodek. He
went to a government school in Minsk, and later attended
the University of Vilna, which city in his day was a place
of Jesuit faith, gloomy convents and echoing bells. All
about him epoch-making events for Slav lands were taking
place. It was a resounding, inspired age for his race, and
he grew up to take a fitting place in that age and to be
called "the immortal hero of Polish poetry." Poland just
then was the battle-ground not only for the armies of
Europe, but for the diplomats. It was a place for statesmen
to win their spurs. If accredited to Petersburg or
Warsaw, and successful, they were believed to be equal to
any diplomatic emergency. Eloquence, inspiration, and
patriotic fervor must have cradled his childhood.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[*]</span></a> The full title of the book is: Memories of Pan Severin Soplica, Cupbearer
of Parnau, by Count Henry Rzewuski.</p></div>

<p>At the time of the birth of Mickiewicz, Russia was
bringing to a close a prodigious period of development in
almost every field of human activity. It was really the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_IX" id="Page_IX">[IX]</a></span>
birth-throe of a nation that was to move powerfully, and to
dominate&mdash;partially&mdash;the new age. And the splendid and
never again to be equalled pageant of the life of Catherine
the Great, with its wild dreams of world dominance and of
the glorious revival of perished Greece, had just been unrolled
for the amazement of Europe. What dramatic and
enchanting memories the names of her followers call up:
the Orlows, Potemkin, Panin, Poniatowski, Bestushew-Rjumin,
Princess Daschkov, Razumowski.</p>

<p>In France, too, the same preceding period had been brilliant.
It had been the France of Voltaire, the Encyclopedists,
and a most resplendent and luxurious monarch. England
had known her greatest orators and prime ministers.
It had been the Prussia of Frederick the Great; the Dresden
of August the Strong; the Austria of Joseph the Second.</p>

<p>A little later&mdash;during Mickiewicz's own youth&mdash;Goethe
was at the height of his power and the intellectual dictator
of Europe. Under his direction and encouragement the
treasures of oriental literature were being translated and
made known to the West. This is merely a hasty glimpse of
the "mise-en-scene" that preceded the debut in life of the
most renowned of Polish poets. The old traditions of absolute
and God-created monarchs and princely times were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_X" id="Page_X">[X]</a></span>
coming to an end, and that democratic modern world,
where everything was to change, was close at hand, just
over the crest, indeed, of this new century into which Fate
was ushering him. He was to see the last of blind power
and royal prerogative, and the first dawn of a modern
spirit which in time would sweep away forever, the old.
It was an uncertain, difficult transition period, without
standards and without measurements.</p>

<p>As we take a fleeting, bird's-eye view of the stirring times
in which his days were spent, his travels, his army life,
his periods of professorship, we can not help but wonder at
the amount of writing Mickiewicz did. And his life was
not a long one; it did not reach to sixty years. But during
the working years allotted him, before a mystical melancholy
&mdash;which was threatening to degenerate into madness&mdash;had
impaired his faculties, his mind was unusually brilliant,
creative and marvelously disciplined. It obeyed at
will. At one time he was professor of Latin in Lausanne;
at another time he held the chair of Slavic languages in
Paris. He taught Polish and Latin in Kovno. He traveled
extensively in Italy in the interest of the Polish revolution.
His mind was many-sided and capable of various
activities. He devoted considerable time to advanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XI" id="Page_XI">[XI]</a></span>
mathematics and philosophy. He made scientific investigations
in Vilna under Lalewel. At one time and another
he lived in various large cities of Europe. In Germany
he met and became friendly with Goethe. In Switzerland
he met Krasinski. In 1833 he married Celina
Szymanovska. Her mother was the famous Slav beauty
and musician who had so delighted Goethe in her youth.</p>

<p>Among writers of Russia and Poland whose life period
somewhat coincided with that of Mickiewicz's are: Korzenowski
(born in 1797), the novelist (a brother of Adam
Mickiewicz was fellow-teacher with Korzenowski at Charkov);
Danilewski (1829), likewise a novelist&mdash;it was he
who translated The Crimean Sonnets into Russian; Malzweski,
Polish patriot and poet, whose "Maria"&mdash;perhaps
the most popular poetic story in Poland&mdash;appeared at
almost the same time as The Crimean Sonnets; Zaleski
(1802), Slowacki (1809), Krasinski (1812), the three
greatest poets of Poland excepting only Mickiewicz himself,
the Polish critic, Brodzinski.</p>

<p>In Russia, the golden age of literature almost covered
the same period as Mickiewicz's own life&mdash;Puschkin,
Lermontov, Schukowski, Gogol, to mention only some of
the most important names.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XII" id="Page_XII">[XII]</a></span>
In the eighteen-thirties we find Mickiewicz in Paris,
which happened to be filled just then with a crowd of brilliant
Slavic exiles. Here he became the friend of Chopin, and
one of Chopin's most talented pupils&mdash;a young Polish girl&mdash;made
the first translation of the Sonnets into French.
It was a wonderful and brilliant Paris which Mickiewicz
entered. This was the time when the city was first called
"the stepmother of Genius." Heine was here in exile, and
B&ouml;rne. It knew the personal fascination and the denunciative
writings of Ferdinand la Salle. It was the day, too, of
Eugene Sue, Berlioz, George Sand, de Musset, Dumas,
Gautier, the Goncourt Brothers, Gavarni, Sainte Beuve,
Liszt, Felix Mendelssohn, Ary Scheffer, Delacroiz, Horace
Vernet&mdash;to mention only a few great names at random.
Julius Slowacki, Count Krasinski and Adam Mickiewicz
were all here editing their poetry in the midst of this
brilliant life in the inspiring city by the Seine. This
period in Paris signs perhaps the high-water mark of the
creative genius of Mickiewicz. He had already written the
Ballads and Romances, the third part of Dziady, Pan
Tadeuz.</p>

<p>The Crimean Sequence belongs to the period of Mickiewicz's
youth, the Vilna period. He joined a society at this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIII" id="Page_XIII">[XIII]</a></span>
time which was looked upon with disfavor by the Government.
At length, because of his continued participation in
it, he was exiled to southern Russia. On that trip, while he
was going toward Odessa, he began the Crimean Sonnets.
Their success was quick and astonishing. They were
translated into every language of Europe. Although the
form is the traditional and classic sonnet form, he makes
use of it in a slightly different manner, not altogether as an
exposition of the sentiments of the soul, and the convictions
and emotions of the mind, but as an instrument with
which to sketch what he saw upon this eventful journey.
He used the sonnet form at that period just as Verhaeren
used it in "Les Flamandes," to show us Flanders, and as
Albert Samain in "Le Chariot d'Or," to picture the gardens
of Versailles. This is worthy of note. And this we
must remember was before 1826. In the poetical works of
Mickiewicz there was always traceable an inclination to
break tradition and to search for new and untried possibilities.</p>

<p>On this exile in Russia he learned to know Puschkin,
then a young man like himself. Puschkin has written a
verse letter to him which we transcribe in free prose. "He
lived among us for a while&mdash;a people strange to him. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIV" id="Page_XIV">[XIV]</a></span>
yet his mind cherished no hatred and no longing for revenge.
Generous, kind of heart, noble-minded, he joined
our evening circles, and we loved him. We exchanged our
dreams, our plans&mdash;our poems. God gave him genius and
inspiration. He stood always on the heights and looked
down on life. We talked of history and of nations. He
declared a time would come when races would forget all
evil things&mdash;like war, rebellion&mdash;and dwell together peaceably
in one great family. We listened to him eagerly for he
had the gift of speech. After a while he went away and we
gave our blessing to him. Then we learned our guest&mdash;spurred
on by his revengeful race&mdash;had become our enemy.
To please that bitter race of his he filled his songs with
hatred. Of our beloved friend there came to us only revenge
and angry thoughts. God grant that peace may come
again to his embittered heart!"</p>

<p>Puschkin himself wrote eloquently of these same Crimean
scenes that Mickiewicz shows us. He, too, was inspired
by the old capital city of the Tartar rulers. We
recall his "Fountain of Baktschi Serai." And he, too,
brings before our eyes again that gigantic mountain world
of southern Russia in "The Prisoner of the Caucasus."</p>

<p>The fame of The Crimean Sonnets was so great that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XV" id="Page_XV">[XV]</a></span>
Mickiewicz was offered a government position which attached
him to the person of the powerful Prince Galitzin,
in Moscow. It was in Rome, and singularly enough it was
when he wrote the "Ode to Youth" that he began to devote
himself to mystical studies which had such an injurious
effect upon his mind. For some time after he had lost his
fluent power as a poet, he retained his conversational gifts
which were remarkable and brought him almost as much
fame as his poetry. His life ended in a period as dramatic
as that in which it began. He entered the Turkish wars in
1855 and died in Stamboul in that same year. It is somewhat
peculiar and at the same time no little to his credit
that he should have chosen the sonnet as the instrument of
his quick sketching of Crimea on the trip of exile, because
the sonnet has never been a frequently chosen means of expression
of the Slav races, despite the numerous sonnets
written later by Vrchlicky, Preseren and others. The sonnet
has belonged more to the Latin races, and to the English
race. The Crimean Sonnets, however, rank among the
famous sequences.</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
